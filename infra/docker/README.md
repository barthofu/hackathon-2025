# About

- [Docker](https://docker.com/) is an open source project to pack, ship and run any Linux application in a lighter weight, faster container than a traditional virtual machine.

- Docker makes it much easier to deploy [a Seafile server](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile) on your servers and keep it updated.

- The base image configures Seafile with the Seafile team's recommended optimal defaults.

If you are not familiar with docker commands, please refer to [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

## Getting Started

Please refer to the [Deploy Documentation](https://manual.seafile.com/docker/deploy_seafile_with_docker/).
